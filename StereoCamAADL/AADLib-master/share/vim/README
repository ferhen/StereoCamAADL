An AADL mode for vim

AADLib provides an AADL mode for vim, located in the share/vim directory.

The AADL mode for vim is made of two files aadl.vim: one for syntactic
coloration, and the other for indentation. The file for indentation
must be placed into ~/.vim/indent/ while the one for syntactic
coloration must be placed into ~/.vim/syntax/

To load the AADL mode whenever you edit AADL files, create a file
named ~/.vim/filetype.vim, in which you write:

 augroup filetypedetect
         au BufNewFile,BufRead *.aadl    setf aadl
 augroup END

For more details, please read the documentation of vim.
